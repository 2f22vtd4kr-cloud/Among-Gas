# Session Handoff Log

> **Protocol for Replit agents**: At the start of every session, read this file top-to-bottom before doing anything else. At the end of every session (or after any significant chunk of work), append a new dated entry under `## Sessions` following the exact format below. Commit the file with the rest of your changes.

---

## Format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary of session goal>

**Done**
- Bullet list of completed work (be specific: file paths, decisions made, commands run)

**Decisions & gotchas**
- Non-obvious choices a future agent needs to know (why something was done a certain way)

**Left off / next steps**
- Where work stopped, what the user asked for but wasn't finished, or what the obvious next move is

**State to restore**
- Any temporary code changes that need reverting, flags to flip, env vars to set, etc.
```

## Sessions

### 2026-07-09 — Project import, environment setup, collision map rewrite

**Done**
- Ran `pnpm install` to install all dependencies (node_modules were missing on import)
- Configured and started three workflows:
  - `artifacts/telegram-game: web` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/telegram-game run dev`
  - `artifacts/api-server: API Server` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev`
  - `artifacts/mockup-sandbox: Component Preview Server` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/mockup-sandbox run dev`
- Completely rewrote `artifacts/telegram-game/src/game/collisionMap.ts` based on a reference image (`attached_assets/IMG_2907_1783590932507.jpeg`) showing the correct red-line collision boundaries
  - Old map had wrong zone boundaries and incorrect obstacle positions
  - New map: 16 walkable zones carved from a fully-blocked 52×29 grid, then obstacles re-blocked inside each zone
  - Key zones: NW Garage, Industrial/Boiler, Pipe Corridor, Main Lobby, NE Tech Room, NE Connector, Far-Right Strip, East Office, Gas Station, Outdoor Park, South Junction, SE Vehicle Garage, SE Corridor, Electrical Room, Far-SE Strip
- Placed the game map as a live iframe on the canvas with the collision overlay enabled for review

**Decisions & gotchas**
- The collision grid is 52 cols × 29 rows, CELL = 20px, map = 1040×580px — keep these constants in sync if the map image ever changes size
- `buildCollisionGrid()` caches its result in `_cached`; if you change the fill calls, set `_cached = null` or restart the dev server to see changes
- `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) is **not configured** — the API server starts fine but any route that touches the DB will fail. A Replit PostgreSQL database needs to be provisioned
- CORS on the API server is wide open (`*`) — acceptable for dev, must be tightened before production

**Left off / next steps**
- Database is not connected — next logical step is provisioning a Replit PostgreSQL DB and setting `DATABASE_URL`
- Collision overlay was turned ON by default (`useState(true)`) for canvas review — see "State to restore" below
- No game logic / player movement has been built yet; the map + collision system is the foundation

**State to restore**
- `artifacts/telegram-game/src/pages/GameMap.tsx` line with `useState(true)` for `showCollision` should be reverted to `useState(false)` — it was set to `true` temporarily so the canvas iframe showed the overlay on load

### 2026-07-09 — Pixel-accurate collision map (supersedes previous session's hand-drawn version)

**Done**
- Replaced the hand-drawn rectangle collision map with one generated directly from the red-line reference image (`attached_assets/IMG_2907_1783593845208.jpeg`) via a new analysis script, `scripts/src/analyzeCollisionMap.ts` (run with `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts exec tsx src/analyzeCollisionMap.ts` to regenerate if the reference image changes).
- Algorithm: detect red boundary pixels → dilate 2px → flood-fill "outside" from the image border → connected-component-label the remainder → components under a size threshold (~7000px) are classified as blocked obstacles, larger ones as walkable room floors → downsampled to a logical grid via majority vote (35% threshold biased toward blocked, so thin walls survive downsampling).
- Grid resolution changed from the old 52×29 (`CELL=20`) to 104×58 (`CELL=10`) so it divides evenly into `MAP_W=1040`/`MAP_H=580` with finer accuracy.
- Output is RLE-encoded into `artifacts/telegram-game/src/game/collisionData.ts` (generated file — regenerate via the script above, don't hand-edit).
- `artifacts/telegram-game/src/game/collisionMap.ts` now decodes `collisionData.ts` via `decodeRuns()` instead of hand-coded `fill()` rectangle calls; added a runtime assertion that decoded length matches `COLS*ROWS`, throwing a clear error pointing at the regen script if it's ever out of sync.
- Re-eyeballed and updated the coarse `ZONES` boxes (debug-overlay hover labels only, not used by collision logic) to roughly match the new finer grid — still approximate, see code comment.
- Verified visually: collision overlay aligns with the reference image's red lines; `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- Cleaned up: removed the throwaway `scripts/src/debugMask.ts` visualization script used only for iterating on the detection algorithm.

**Decisions & gotchas**
- `sharp` was added as a devDependency to `@workspace/scripts` — kept intentionally, it's needed to re-run the analysis script if the reference image ever changes.
- The old handoff entry's zone/grid description (52×29, hand-authored zones) is now obsolete — this entry supersedes it. `_cached` caching behavior in `buildCollisionGrid()` and the "must restart dev server after changing fill calls" note no longer apply since there are no more fill calls; the grid comes from the generated data file.
- ZONES are cosmetic only (debug overlay labels/outlines) and intentionally coarse — don't rely on them for gameplay logic; collision/movement always uses the pixel-derived grid.

**Left off / next steps**
- No player/movement system exists yet — the map + pixel-accurate collision grid is the foundation for that.
- Database still not connected (`DATABASE_URL` unset) — unchanged from previous session, still needs a Replit PostgreSQL DB provisioned if/when the API server needs persistence.
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox: Component Preview Server` and `artifacts/api-server: API Server` workflows are running (auto-started with the environment); user asked to leave them as-is rather than actively use them this session.

**State to restore**
- None — `showCollision` in `GameMap.tsx` is confirmed `false` (default, non-overlay) after this session's edits.
