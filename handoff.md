# Session Handoff Log

> **Protocol for Replit agents**: At the start of every session, read this file top-to-bottom before doing anything else. At the end of every session (or after any significant chunk of work), append a new dated entry under `## Sessions` following the exact format below. Commit the file with the rest of your changes.

## Format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary of session goal>

**Done**
- Bullet list of completed work (be specific: file paths, decisions made, commands run)

**Decisions & gotchas**
- Non-obvious choices a future agent needs to know (why something was done a certain way)

**Left off / next steps**
- Where work stopped, what the user asked for but wasn't finished, or what the obvious next move is

**State to restore**
- Any temporary code changes that need reverting, flags to flip, env vars to set, etc.
```

### 2026-07-09 — Project import, environment setup, collision map rewrite

**Done**
- Ran `pnpm install` to install all dependencies (node_modules were missing on import)
- Configured and started three workflows:
  - `artifacts/telegram-game: web` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/telegram-game run dev`
  - `artifacts/api-server: API Server` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev`
  - `artifacts/mockup-sandbox: Component Preview Server` → `pnpm --filter @workspace/mockup-sandbox run dev`
- Completely rewrote `artifacts/telegram-game/src/game/collisionMap.ts` based on a reference image (`attached_assets/IMG_2907_1783590932507.jpeg`) showing the correct red-line collision boundaries
  - Old map had wrong zone boundaries and incorrect obstacle positions
  - New map: 16 walkable zones carved from a fully-blocked 52×29 grid, then obstacles re-blocked inside each zone
  - Key zones: NW Garage, Industrial/Boiler, Pipe Corridor, Main Lobby, NE Tech Room, NE Connector, Far-Right Strip, East Office, Gas Station, Outdoor Park, South Junction, SE Vehicle Garage, SE Corridor, Electrical Room, Far-SE Strip
- Placed the game map as a live iframe on the canvas with the collision overlay enabled for review

**Decisions & gotchas**
- The collision grid is 52 cols × 29 rows, CELL = 20px, map = 1040×580px — keep these constants in sync if the map image ever changes size
- `buildCollisionGrid()` caches its result in `_cached`; if you change the fill calls, set `_cached = null` or restart the dev server to see changes
- `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) is **not configured** — the API server starts fine but any route that touches the DB will fail. A Replit PostgreSQL database needs to be provisioned
- CORS on the API server is wide open (`*`) — acceptable for dev, must be tightened before production

**Left off / next steps**
- Database is not connected — next logical step is provisioning a Replit PostgreSQL DB and setting `DATABASE_URL`
- Collision overlay was turned ON by default (`useState(true)`) for canvas review — see "State to restore" below
- No game logic / player movement has been built yet; the map + collision system is the foundation

**State to restore**
- `artifacts/telegram-game/src/pages/GameMap.tsx` line with `useState(true)` for `showCollision` should be reverted to `useState(false)` — it was set to `true` temporarily so the canvas iframe showed the overlay on load
